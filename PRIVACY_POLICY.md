# Privacy Policy for Chipa SSID Finder

**Last updated: November 30, 2025**

## Introduction

Chipa SSID Finder ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles information when you use our services.

## Information We Don't Collect

**Chipa SSID Finder does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

Specifically, we do NOT:
- Collect login credentials or passwords
- Store authentication tokens or SSID data
- Track user behavior or analytics
- Collect device information
- Share data with third parties
- Use advertising or tracking services
- Require user accounts or registration

## How the App Works

1. **WebView Login**: When you select a trading platform, the app opens a secure WebView where you log in directly to the trading platform's website
2. **Cookie Extraction**: After successful login, the app extracts only the session cookie (SSID token) from the WebView
3. **Local Display**: The SSID is displayed only on your device
4. **Clipboard Copy**: When you copy the SSID, it's stored in your device's clipboard temporarily
5. **No Storage**: Once you close the app or navigate away, the SSID is cleared and not stored anywhere

## Data Storage

- **No Cloud Storage**: Nothing is uploaded to our servers (we don't have servers)
- **No Local Database**: The app doesn't save any data to your device storage
- **Temporary Memory Only**: SSID tokens exist only in the app's temporary memory while displayed
- **WebView Cookies**: Trading platform cookies are managed by the Android WebView component and follow standard browser behavior

## Third-Party Services

### Trading Platforms
When you log in to trading platforms (OlympTrade, PocketOptions, etc.), you are subject to their respective privacy policies:
- Your interaction with these platforms is direct
- We do not intercept, modify, or store your credentials
- Session data is handled according to each platform's policies

### Android WebView
The app uses Android's WebView component, which is provided and maintained by Google. WebView follows Android's standard privacy and security practices.

## Permissions

The app requests only necessary permissions:

### Internet Permission
- **Why**: Required to load trading platform websites in the WebView
- **Usage**: Only used to display web pages you explicitly navigate to

### Network State Permission
- **Why**: To check if device has internet connectivity
- **Usage**: To show appropriate messages if offline

## Security

- **Secure WebView**: All connections use HTTPS where supported by the trading platform
- **No Data Transmission**: Your data never leaves your device through our app
- **Session Isolation**: Each WebView session is independent
- **No Tracking**: We don't implement any analytics or tracking

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there is nothing to:
- Access

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app

## Data Deletion

Since we don't store any data, there is no data to delete. If you want to remove all traces:
1. Uninstall the app
2. Clear your device's clipboard (if you copied SSID recently)
3. Clear browser cookies for the trading platforms you accessed

- Google Play Store policies
- Android privacy guidelines
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
